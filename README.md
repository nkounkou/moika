# moika

goal:
modular koika (statically-typed fjfj with a verified compiler to rtl)

currently:
UCompiler.v

next steps:
- define language and circuit semantics
- declare proofs, including top-level theorem statement
- improve compiler efficiency (e.g. compiled child-module circuits should never be copied) and prove things
- many other TODO's listed in UCompiler.v (including a type system)
